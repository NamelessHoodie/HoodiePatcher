Difficulty Module:
This allows difficulty settings for dark souls 3 based on preset(hardcoded) templates and user set multipliers in the config.

DebugAnimSpeed Enabler:
Pretty simple, it enables the homonymous TAE event.

HkObjects limit extender:
This is also pretty self explanatory, it extends the behbnd Hkobject limit in behbnd.
